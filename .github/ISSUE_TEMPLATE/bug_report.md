When creating a new issue please attach a `debug.log` file as that'll really help.

To do that go to `%appdata%\UniversalAnnouncer` directory and edit your `config.json` so that the line `"IsDebugModeEnabled": false,` is set to `true`. Remove any existing `debug.log` and restart the app for a clean recreating file. Thanks~
