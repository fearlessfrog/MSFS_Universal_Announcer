# Universal Announcer

![Universal Announcer Logo](images/logo.jpg)

**Plays Fenix A320 compatible Cabin Announcements on any aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator.**

Universal Announcer automatically detects your flight state and plays realistic cabin announcements based on your aircraft's conditions - boarding music, safety briefings, takeoff announcements, and more. Originally designed around the Fenix A320 sound files, it works with any aircraft in MSFS.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Features

- **Automatic Flight State Detection**: Monitors aircraft lights, engines, altitude, and ground status
- **Airline-Specific Announcements**: Supports airline folders (UAL, ACA, BAW, DAL, etc.)
- **Aircraft Type Variants**: Plays different announcements for A319, A320, A321, 737, etc.
- **Time-Based Variants**: Morning, afternoon, evening, and night announcements
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimal interface with volume control and flight state override
- **Test Mode**: Built-in test harness for development and troubleshooting

This app follows the announcements detailed here: https://support.fenixsim.com/hc/en-us/articles/12374580682383-Cabin-Announcements-Guide

## üéµ Sound Files

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: No sound files are included with this application. This application does not include any copyright sound files.**

You can obtain compatible sound files from:

1. **Fenix A320 Installation**: If you own the Fenix A320, the sound files are already installed
2. **Cabin Announcements Discord**: Join the [Cabin Announcements for Fenix](https://discord.com/invite/P8ZYJgH3ZF) Discord server for community-created sound files

## üìã System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Flight Simulator**: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (MSFS 2024 should work but untested)
- **Runtime**: .NET 8 (included with Windows by default)
- **Sound Files**: Compatible announcement files (see above)

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Download**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/fearlessfrog/MSFS_Universal_Announcer/releases) section and download the latest version
2. **Extract**: Unzip the downloaded file to any directory (e.g., `C:\Universal Announcer\`)
3. **Run**: Double-click `UniversalAnnouncer.exe` to start the application

The application will appear in your system tray and automatically try to locate your sound files.

## üîß Setup

### First Launch

1. **Run the application** - It will appear in your system tray
2. **Configure sound files path** - The app will try to auto-detect your Fenix installation location, or you can browse to your sound files folder
3. **Set up MSFS** - Configure your aircraft callsign (see below)

You can probably include this in your `exe.xml` eventually for automatic use although I haven't tried that yet. There are still bugs in start-up detections, so use Flight Status / Stop if annoying (you can Resume when ready).

### MSFS Configuration

This step is **temporary** while I add Navigraph simbrief support, but depends on demand:

For airline-specific announcements, set your **Callsign** in MSFS:

1. In MSFS, go to **World Map ‚Üí Aircraft Selection ‚Üí Customization (tab)**
2. Set **Callsign** to your airline code (e.g., `UAL`, `ACA`, `BAW`, `DAL` just the letters alone, no flight #)
3. The app will automatically detect your aircraft type (737, CRJ900, A320, etc.)

### Sound File Structure

Your sound files should be organized like this:
```
Announcements/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Default/           # Fallback announcements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UAL/              # United Airlines
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ACA/              # Air Canada
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BAW/              # British Airways
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DAL/              # Delta Airlines
```

Each folder contains files like:
- `BoardingWelcome.ogg`
- `BoardingWelcome[CRJ900].ogg` (aircraft-specific)
- `BoardingWelcome[Morning][737].ogg` (time-specific)
- `SafetyBriefing.ogg`
- `AfterTakeoff.ogg`
- And many more as per Fenix structure...

## üéÆ Usage

### System Tray Menu

Right-click the system tray icon to access:

- **Flight State**: Override automatic detection or restart the sequence
- **Stop/Resume**: Pause/resume all announcements
- **Audio Device**: Select your preferred audio output
- **Volume**: Adjust announcement volume

- **About**: Version information and debug mode

### Automatic Operation

The app automatically detects your flight phase based on:
- **Ground status** (on ground, parking, runway)
- **Engine status** (running, combustion)
- **Light status** (beacon, logo, landing lights)
- **Altitude and speed**
- **Spoiler deployment**

### Manual Override

You can manually set the flight state via the system tray menu:
- **Auto**: Let the app detect automatically (default)
- **Restart**: Reset to beginning of flight sequence
- **Cruise**: Jump to cruise phase

## üîß Configuration

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

2. **Wrong airline**: Set your MSFS Callsign to the correct airline code
3. **Announcements not triggering**: Try the manual flight state override
4. **Audio device issues**: Select your correct audio device in Settings
