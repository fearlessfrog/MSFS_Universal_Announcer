    <value>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard. Please pay attention to illuminated signs and crew instructions, including the following safety procedures. The safety card found in your seat pocket contains important information about exit locations, oxygen masks, life jackets, and the brace position. There are emergency exits located at the front, over the wings, and at the rear. Please locate your nearest exit; it may be behind you. Emergency lighting will guide you to an exit{IF AIRCRAFT_NAME} on this {AIRCRAFT_NAME}{END}. In an emergency, leave all baggage on board. Your seatbelt fastens, adjusts, and releases as shown. It must be fastened whenever the seatbelt signs are on, and we recommend that you keep it fastened at all times. If the air supply fails, masks will drop from above you. Pull a mask towards you to start the oxygen. Put the mask over your nose and mouth and breathe normally. Hold the mask in place with the strap, pull on each side to adjust, and put on your own mask before helping others. If we land on water, take a life jacket from under your seat. Remove it from the pouch and put it over your head. Pass the tapes around your waist and click together. Pull the strap to adjust. Do not inflate the life jacket inside the aircraft. When outside, inflate it by pulling the toggle. If it fails to inflate or needs topping up, blow into the tube. There is a light and whistle for attracting attention. The cabin crew can assist you with life jackets for children. Your tray table must now be stowed, armrests down, window blinds open, and seatbelt fastened. We hope you have a great flight.</value>
