# Future Feature Ideas

- ArmDoors tweak option to play after BoardingComplete automatically rather than trigger

- Be able to set voice Roles, e.g. ##Role: pilot FA groundcrew and set voices to them, have a dialog for that with Edge defaults.

- Additional sounds/states ideas not in the current Fenix spec, but will need sound pack support e.g.

  - Cabin noise at different periods (that is not covered by GSX) e.g. murmurs etc

  - Dispatch Release (ground agent paperwork/load sheet info etc) step

  - Turbulence announcements (using cabin g-force and movement detection)

  - Reached TOC Cruise altitude announcement, for service etc other than CruiseElapsed, plus TOD (like CruiseElapsed)

  - Diversion / Medical Emergency announcements, using the Alternate destination in flight plan etc.

  - Scenic landmark announcements using sim Points of Interest lookup. Relies more on generated tts

- Improve use of Boarding Music. Use other variants e.g. BoardingMusic[1].ogg, BoardingMusic[2].ogg in the play loop, which sort of bends the rules a bit of the set numbers used (they are meant for consistent voices, as when randomized per flight they stick during the flight). This would be just to vary the music up a bit.

Feel free to create a blank issue if you want to comment on any of these in terms of importance.
