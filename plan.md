# Future Feature Ideas

- Some sort of camera substate detection for better 'Cabin' detection for sound volume e.g. quick views etc. It won't be perfect but better than plain 'Show case camera' detection.

- WASM experiment for Seat belt detection in add-ins, e.g. MobiFlight or WASimCommander open source etc
  Wasm thing to have to put in community folder and then check l:var request for?

- Aircraft type tidy up for detection without simbrief, e.g. better lookup to make ICAO type codes.

- Some sort of Aircraft 'family' hierarchy for files e.g. [737] for [B737] [B738] etc so less tags needed in sound file combos.

- Add the location tag as requested, e.g. AfterLanding.ogg plus also AfterLanding[OMDB].ogg as well as AfterLanding[OMDB][A380].ogg detection, so a hierarchy where the most hits gets used first.

Feel free to create a blank issue if you want to comment on any of these in terms of importance.
